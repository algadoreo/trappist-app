# TRAPPIST app

A web app of the [SYSTEM Sounds](http://www.system-sounds.com) planetary sonification + animation project.

This is not a simulation of the TRAPPIST-1 system and, as such, the positions of the planets are only approximate. For an accurate simulation of the system, we have a separate N-body code (written in Python) available at [github.com/dtamayo/systemsounds](https://github.com/dtamayo/systemsounds).

### Getting started

This web app uses the Web Audio API, so we recommend using the latest version of **Google Chrome**, **Mozilla Firefox**, or **Apple Safari**.
